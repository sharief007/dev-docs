### Summary

- **RabbitMQ:** Best for general-purpose messaging with complex routing needs and a moderate learning curve. Supports various use cases, including task distribution and decoupling services.
- **ActiveMQ:** Suitable for traditional enterprise messaging with rich feature sets like message prioritization, transaction support, and complex routing.
- **Apache Kafka:** Ideal for high-throughput use cases like event streaming, log aggregation, and real-time data processing. More complex but extremely powerful and scalable.
- **NATS:** Great for lightweight, low-latency messaging, real-time communication, and IoT. Easier to manage but may lack some advanced features compared to others.
