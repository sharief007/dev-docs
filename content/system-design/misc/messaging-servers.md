### Summary 

- **RabbitMQ:** Best for general-purpose messaging with complex routing needs and a moderate learning curve. Suitable for task distribution and decoupling services.
- **ActiveMQ:** Suitable for traditional enterprise messaging with rich feature sets like message prioritization, transaction support, and complex routing.
- **Apache Kafka:** Ideal for high-throughput use cases like event streaming, log aggregation, and real-time data processing. More complex but extremely powerful and scalable.
- **NATS:** Great for lightweight, low-latency messaging, real-time communication, and IoT. Easier to manage but may lack some advanced features compared to others.
- **Apache Pulsar:** Strong competitor to Kafka with additional features like multi-tiered storage, native support for multi-tenancy, and geo-replication. Suitable for both streaming and traditional messaging use cases, offering a rich feature set with moderate complexity.
