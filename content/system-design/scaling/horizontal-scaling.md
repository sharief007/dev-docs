Horizontal scaling, also known as scaling out, involves increasing the capacity of a system by adding more machines to a network. This approach is widely used to handle increased workloads and ensure high availability.

### Pros and Cons of Horizontal Scaling:

**Pros:**
1. **Improved Performance:** Horizontal scaling allows for the distribution of the load across multiple machines, which can significantly improve the overall performance and response times of a system.

2. **High Availability:** In the event of a hardware failure or maintenance, the system remains operational as traffic is distributed across multiple servers. This ensures high availability and reduces downtime.

3. **Cost-Efficiency:** Scaling horizontally is often more cost-effective as it involves adding commodity hardware. This can be less expensive than upgrading to more powerful, and therefore more expensive, individual machines.

**Cons:**
1. **Complexity in Data Management:** Managing data consistency across multiple machines can be more challenging in a horizontally scaled system compared to vertical scaling (scaling up).

2. **Network Overheads:** There may be additional overhead for network communication between the different nodes. This can lead to increased latency in some scenarios.

### Load Balancers:

Load balancing is a critical component of horizontal scaling.  It involves distributing incoming network traffic or requests across multiple servers to ensure that no single server becomes overwhelmed. They serve as the entry point for clients.

There are hardware-based load balancers and software-based load balancers. Hardware load balancers are dedicated devices, while software load balancers are implemented using software on standard servers.

Here are some key points about load balancing:

#### Algorithms for Load Balancing:

Load balancers use various algorithms to distribute traffic. Common ones include:
- Round Robin: Requests are distributed in a circular sequence to each server.
- Least Connections: Traffic is sent to the server with the fewest active connections.
- IP Hash: Based on the client's IP address, requests are sent to a specific server, ensuring that a client's requests always go to the same server.

#### Health Checks 

Load balancers should regularly check the health of the servers to ensure that they are responsive. Unresponsive servers should be temporarily taken out of rotation.

#### Scalability

The load balancer itself should be scalable. This can be achieved by using a combination of techniques such as DNS-based load balancing or deploying multiple load balancers in an active-passive or active-active configuration.

#### SSL Termination 

If SSL encryption is used, the load balancer can handle SSL termination to offload the decryption process from the application servers, improving performance.


### Handling Deployments:

Deploying updates in a horizontally scaled environment requires careful planning to ensure minimal downtime and service disruption. Best practices include:

1. **Rolling Deployments:** Gradually update servers one at a time, ensuring that there is no noticeable service disruption. This can be done by taking nodes out of the load balancer, updating them, and then adding them back.

2. **Canary Releases:** Deploy new versions to a small subset of servers first to validate that the update is stable before rolling it out to the entire fleet.

3. **Blue-Green Deployments:** Maintain two identical production environments, one active (blue) and one inactive (green). Deploy updates to the inactive environment, test thoroughly, and then switch traffic to the updated environment.

In conclusion, horizontal scaling offers numerous benefits, including improved performance, high availability, and cost-efficiency. However, it also introduces complexities in data management and application design. Load balancers are crucial for evenly distributing traffic, and proper session management is essential for maintaining user state. Thoughtful deployment strategies help minimize downtime and ensure a smooth update process. Adhering to these best practices can help organizations effectively scale their systems horizontally.
