Database replication is a technique used to create and maintain multiple copies of a database, often referred to as replicas. The purpose of replication is to provide redundancy, improve availability, and distribute the load for both read and write operations.

### Benefits of Database Replication

**Load Distribution**:
Read queries can be directed to the replicas, reducing the load on the primary database and improving overall performance.

**Redundancy**:
Replicas serve as backups in case of data loss or corruption on the master database.

**Geographic Distribution**:
Replicas can be located in different geographic regions, providing lower latency access for users in different parts of the world.

**High Availability**:
Replication provides failover capability. If the master database goes down, one of the replicas can take over, minimizing downtime.
